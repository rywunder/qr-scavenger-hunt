# qr-scavenger-hunt
Ionic mobile app for custom scavenger hunts

## Motivation
I came up with this idea as I was walking in the San Diego zoo. I love the zoo, but I found myself wishing I could learn more  about each animal at the exhibits without having to google it myself. I thought that having a QR code on each exhibit could be a way to add more information while keeping the zoo fun!  You can walk around a zoo with the app and "collect" all the animals by scanning their QR codes. It's like a real life pokedex.

## Future plans for project
Right now the JSON file containing all the information for animals is stored locally. The next step will be to get animal data from a service like the [Encyclopedia of Life](http://eol.org/api). That way users can create animal collections for each zoo.
